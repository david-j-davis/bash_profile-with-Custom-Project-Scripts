# bash_profile-with-Custom-Project-Scripts
- Mac OS Bash profile based on NATHANIEL LANDAU's original. Added scripts to initiate a handful of project at startup
- First create a hidden bash profile in your home directory ```cd ~ touch .bash_profile```
- Copy the contents of this bash_profile.sh into your newly created hidden bash file
- Next download the BASH-SCRIPTS folder to your home root directory
- (optional) Add Terminal in System Preferences as a 'Login Item' to your profile so it opens at start up

- Now inside terminal type in ```work``` if you want to open a url or start an Application
- Type ```start``` if you want to start a basic Express server project or an AngularJS seed project, etc.
- Type ```css``` if you want to query the full gamut of css component resets

Modify any of these bash scripts or add new bash scripts. Don't forget to look at Section 8) Web Development in the .bash_profile to add to the list of calls to custom bash scripts.
